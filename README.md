# list_unprotected_docker_engines

Scan account for servers running docker, which do not have Docker inspection
(ContainerSecure) enabled.

## What is this?

This is a tool which will use your Halo API credentials to scan your Halo
account for instances which are running Docker but do not have ContainerSecure enabled.

Using the `--fix` CLI argument will cause the script to enable Docker inspection for
all hosts running the `dockerd` process, which don't already have Docker inspection
enabled.

## Requirements

This tool requires Python 2.7.10+ and the CloudPassage SDK.

Install the CloudPassage SDK with `python2.7 -m pip install cloudpassage`
